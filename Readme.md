WordlyCount
===========
Word count program. Analyzes word frequencies. May help with repetitivity in writing.

Given this input:

I am a rock. I am an island.

The program will output:

am  2
I   2
a   1
an  1
island  1
rock    1

It will ignore "'s", ".", "!", "?", ":", ";", and all others outside A-z.
